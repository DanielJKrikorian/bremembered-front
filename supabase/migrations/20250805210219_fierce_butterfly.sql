  # Allow anonymous leads insertion

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies on anonymous_leads table
    - Create simple policy allowing anonymous users to insert leads
    - Create policy allowing anonymous users to read/update their own session data
    - Create policy allowing authenticated users to read all leads

  This fixes the "new row violates row-level security policy" error by ensuring
  anonymous users can create lead records without authentication.
